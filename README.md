### ATS

ATS (Applicant Tracking System) is software used by employers at almost all conglomerates, even more so at FAANG, to manage applicant screening, resume parsing, and candidate communication. The system streamlines the hiring process by automatically filtering and organizing incoming resumes based on specific criteria set by the employer.

- An ATS friendly resume is usually only a page long
- An ATS friendly resume sticks to a clean, easy-to-read layout with standard fonts and consistent formatting
- Tailor your resume by including relevant keywords from the job description to match the ATS filtering criteria
- ATS avoids graphics and images
- Clearly label sections such as "Work Experience," "Education," and "Skills" to help ATS categorize your information accurately
